1. Install Content Collections and integrate it in your build.

   * [Next.js](/docs/integrations/next)
   * [Vite](/docs/integrations/vite)
   * [CLI (generic integration)](/docs/integrations/cli)

1. Create a `content-collections.ts` file at the root of your project:

   ```ts
   import { defineCollection, defineConfig } from "@content-collections/core";

   const posts = defineCollection({
     name: "posts",
     directory: "src/posts",
     include: "**/*.md",
     schema: (z) => ({
       title: z.string(),
       summary: z.string(),
     }),
   });

   export default defineConfig({
     collections: [posts],
   });
   ```

   This file defines a collection named `posts` in the `src/posts` folder.
   The collection will include all markdown files (`**/*.md`) and the schema will validate the `title` and `summary` fields.

1. Create your content files (e.g.: `src/posts/hello-world.md`):

   ```md
   ---
   title: "Hello world"
   summary: "This is my first post!"
   ---

   # Hello world

   This is my first post!
   ... rest of the content
   ```

   You can create unlimited content files.
   These files will be validated against the schema defined in the `content-collections.ts` file.
   If the files are valid, they will be automatically added to the `posts` collection.

1. Usage in your code:

   ```tsx
   import { allPosts } from "content-collections";

   export function Posts() {
     return (
       <ul>
         {allPosts.map((post) => (
           <li key={post._meta.path}>
             <a href={`/posts/${post._meta.path}`}>
               <h3>{post.title}</h3>
               <p>{post.summary}</p>
             </a>
           </li>
         ))}
       </ul>
     );
   }
   ```

   Now you can just import the `allPosts` collection and use it in your code.
   The `allPosts` collection will contain all posts that are valid.
   The `post` object will contain the `title`, `summary` and `content` fields as well as some meta information in the `_meta` field.
